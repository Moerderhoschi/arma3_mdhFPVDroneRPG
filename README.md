FPV Drone RPG is a mod, created by Moerderhoschi for Arma 3.

HOW THE ADDON WORKS?
Get a UAV Terminal and a Backpack with RPG Grenades and you get an actionMenu entry to assemble a FPV Drone RPG.
You can also use the RPG Grenades of other Units Backpacks, only thing you need then is an UAV Terminal.
